## How to Work With the Phone Spectrophotometer

The Phone Spectrophotometer is quite easy to work with. You'll find here documentation showing how to work with it, some advices/troubleshootings and also suggestions of activities.

After the assembly of the <b>LED Block</b> and <b>Cuvette Holder</b> is time to test it out.

To do so, you’ll need an Android Phone with the Shoebox Spectrophotometer APP installed. You can also try other APPs with Ambient Light Sensor measurement.

<i>Note: In iPhone and iPad you can also use alternative APPs but they will measure the light on camera and not on the Light Sensor (usually next to the front camera of your phone).</i>

Turn on the LED by putting the coin battery CR2032 in the on-position (figure 1).

Next install the model in the phone with the APP launched and try to get an high value of light measurement (figure 2).

<i>Note: Some phone sensors may be more sensible to light than others, causing them to saturate (give a maximum value). The value obtained from a saturated sensor can not be used because it means the sensor can’t read all the light thats reaching it. Try to misalign the model just enough for the value of the light measurement seams to variate.</i>

Now is up to what you want to test! Try the examples in the <b>booklet of spectroscopy activities</b> for you to get used with the technic and the hardware/software.

<i>Note: If you use other softwares you’ll need to calculate manually the absorbance based on the Raw Data obtained (light measurement).</i>








You can make the <b>LED Block</b> with many different LED colours. Here are some typical emission wavelengths from coloured LEDs.

<b>Typical LED Wavelengths</b>


Red Light Diodes - 625nm

Green Light Diodes - 525nm

Blue Light Diodes - 465nm

Orange Light Diodes - 610nm

Yellow Light Diodes - 575nm

<em>Special LEDs</em>

IR Light Diodes - 950nm

UV Light Diodes - 400nm
