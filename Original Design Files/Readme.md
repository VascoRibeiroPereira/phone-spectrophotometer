# Original and Auxiliary Design Files

You will find here the original design files, all made with <i> SketchUp Make</i>, in .skp (its native proprietary format).

To edit it you'll need to download SketchUp Make from [here](https://www.sketchup.com/download/make)

If you only want the auxiliary design files you can use the stereolithography file format (.stl)

The Steady Version solves an issue related to the block position not being fixed into the Phone holder. This way it allows more confidence in calibration curves and further results with reproducibility.

_Important note_: I recommend printing the LED Block - Steady Version horizontally.
